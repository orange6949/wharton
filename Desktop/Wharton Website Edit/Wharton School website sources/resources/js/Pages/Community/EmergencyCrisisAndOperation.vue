                    <p class="body">
                        Since Wharton School is a virtual high school for Grade 9-12 students who study at their own
                        pace and at home mostly, this Emergency Response Plan describes basic information about those
                        situations which may face online schools and will be annually updated to create an even more
                        useful resource for administrators, staff, teachers, students (online learners), and their
                        parents.
                    </p>

                    <p class="body">
                        Most of the school safety concerns associated with emergency management in traditional
                        schools are not relevant with regard to virtual classrooms. However, Wharton School’s
                        administrators will ensure periodical off-site digital backups of critical student records,
                        communicate any district-wide emergency response policies or response actions to online
                        learners and their parents, and ensure that they have continuity of operations plans in the
                        event
                        of extended network or other infrastructure disruptions. Additionally, we encourage students and
                        staff to join Community Emergency Response Teams (CERT) and Teen CERT programs.

                        By following the guidelines of the Department of Education, Nevada
                        (https://dem.nv.gov/Resources/Emergency_Response_Plans/), we utilize the checklist to certify
                        that
                        Wharton School’s EOP meets these standards. This checklist follows the FEMA Guide For
